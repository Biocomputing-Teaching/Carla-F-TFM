Since enzymes traditionally isolated from plants and mammalian tissues or culturable microorganisms do not possess sufficient purity and resistance to harsh conditions of modern food processes, the use of recombinant DNA technology has made possible their utilization in current food processes. This chapter aims to review the main food-grade enzymes in terms of major families and their major features relevant for the food industry. Synthesis, purification, characterization techniques and application of food-grade enzymes are accordingly discussed; finally, safety concerns, regulatory contexts, and future trends are briefly addressed.},

The involvement of these enzymes in physiological and pathological processes is described, especially with respect to their application as diagnostic and prognostic markers. They participate in precursor protein activation (including proenzymes and prohormones), MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation, bone remodeling, keratinocytes differentiation, hair follicle cycle, reproduction and apoptosis. Cysteine cathepsins upregulation has been demonstrated in many human tumors, including breast, lung, brain, gastrointestinal, head and neck cancer, and melanoma. Besides cancer diseases, they have been implied to participate in inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory myopathies, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontitis. Also, certain hereditary disorders are connected with mutations in CCs genes, what is observed in pycnodysostosis resulted from catK gene mutation and Papillon-Lefevre and Haim-Munk syndrome caused by catC gene defect. The potential application of cysteine cathepsins in diagnosis and/or prognosis is discussed in cancer diseases (breast, lung, head and neck, ovarian, gastrointestinal cancers, melanoma), as well as other disorders (periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Several cysteine cathepsins are up-regulated in a mouse model of pancreatic islet cell carcinogenesis (RIP1-Tag2), and tumor progression is impaired following their collective pharmacologic inhibition. Using null mutations of four of the implicated cysteine cathepsins, we have now dissected their individual roles in cancer development. Mutants of cathepsins B or S impaired tumor formation and angiogenesis, while cathepsin B or L knockouts retarded cell proliferation and tumor growth. Absence of any one of these three genes impaired tumor invasion. In contrast, removal of cathepsin C had no effect on either tumor formation or progression. We have identified E-cadherin as a target substrate of cathepsins B, L, and S, but not cathepsin C, potentially explaining their differential effects on tumor invasion. Furthermore, we detected analogous increases in cathepsin expression in human pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, and a significant association between increased levels of cathepsins B and L and tumor malignancy. Thus individual cysteine cathepsin genes make distinctive contributions to tumorigenesis. © 2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Cathepsin activity was assessed using chemical probes allowing biochemical and in vivo imaging, revealing increased activity associated with the angiogenic vasculature and invasive fronts of carcinomas, and differential expression in immune, endothelial, and cancer cells. A broad-spectrum cysteine cathepsin inhibitor was used to pharmacologically knock out cathepsin function at different stages of tumorigenesis, impairing angiogenic switching in progenitor lesions, as well as tumor growth, vascularity, and invasiveness. Cysteine cathepsins are also upregulated during HPV16-induced cervical carcinogenesis, further encouraging consideration of this protease family as a therapeutic target in human cancers.},

   abstract = {The recognition that only a small percentage of known human gene products are druggable using traditional modes of non-covalent ligand design, has led to a resurgence in targeted covalent inhibitors. Covalent inhibitors offer advantages over non-covalent inhibitors in engaging otherwise challenging targets. Reactive cysteine residues on proteins are a common target for covalent inhibitors, whereby the high nucleophilicity of the cysteine thiol under physiological conditions provides an ideal anchoring site for electrophilic small molecules. A chemical-proteomic platform, termed isoTOP-ABPP, allows for profiling cysteine reactivity in complex proteomes and is one of many techniques that can aid in two aspects of the covalent-inhibitor development process: (1) to identify functional cysteines that lead to modulation of protein activity through covalent modification; and, (2) to determine cellular targets and evaluate promiscuity of electrophilic fragments, small molecules, and natural products. Herein, we discuss recent advances in isoTOP-ABPP and potential applications of this technology in the drug-discovery pipeline.},

Covalent inhibitors possess significant advantages over non-covalent inhibitors, such that covalent warheads can target rare residues of a particular target protein, thus leading to the development of highly selective inhibitors. However, toxicity can be a real challenge related to this class of therapeutics. From the challenges of irreversible drug toxicity to the declining reactivity of reversible drugs, herein we provide justifications from the computational point of view. It was evident that both classes had its merits; however, with the increase in drug resistance, covalent inhibition seemed more suitable. There also seems to be enhanced selectivity of the covalent systems, proving its use as a therapeutic regimen worldwide. We believe that this study will assist researchers in making informed decisions on which drug class to choose as lead compounds in the drug discovery pipeline.},

Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL.

   abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease is one of the key targets for drug development against COVID-19. Most known SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors act by covalently binding to the active site cysteine. Yet, computational screens against this enzyme were mainly focused on non-covalent inhibitor discovery. Here, we developed a deep learning-based stepwise strategy for selective covalent inhibitor screen. We used a deep learning framework that integrated a directed message passing neural network with a feed-forward neural network to construct two different classifiers for either covalent or non-covalent inhibition activity prediction. These two classifiers were trained on the covalent and non-covalent 3CL protease inhibitors dataset, respectively, which achieved high prediction accuracy. We then successively applied the covalent inhibitor model and the non-covalent inhibitor model to screen a chemical library containing compounds with covalent warheads of cysteine. We experimentally tested the inhibition activity of 32 top-ranking compounds and 12 of them were active, among which 6 showed IC50 values less than 12 μM and the strongest one inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease with an IC50 of 1.4 μM. Further investigation demonstrated that 5 of the 6 active compounds showed typical covalent inhibition behavior with time-dependent activity. These new covalent inhibitors provide novel scaffolds for developing highly active SARS-CoV-2 3CL covalent inhibitors.},

   abstract = {Background: Cheminformaticians are equipped with a very rich toolbox when carrying out molecular similarity calculations. A large number of molecular representations exist, and there are several methods (similarity and distance metrics) to quantify the similarity of molecular representations. In this work, eight well-known similarity/distance metrics are compared on a large dataset of molecular fingerprints with sum of ranking differences (SRD) and ANOVA analysis. The effects of molecular size, selection methods and data pretreatment methods on the outcome of the comparison are also assessed. Results: A supplier database (https://mcule.com/) was used as the source of compounds for the similarity calculations in this study. A large number of datasets, each consisting of one hundred compounds, were compiled, molecular fingerprints were generated and similarity values between a randomly chosen reference compound and the rest were calculated for each dataset. Similarity metrics were compared based on their ranking of the compounds within one experiment (one dataset) using sum of ranking differences (SRD), while the results of the entire set of experiments were summarized on box and whisker plots. Finally, the effects of various factors (data pretreatment, molecule size, selection method) were evaluated with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Conclusions: This study complements previous efforts to examine and rank various metrics for molecular similarity calculations. Here, however, an entirely general approach was taken to neglect any a priori knowledge on the compounds involved, as well as any bias introduced by examining only one or a few specific scenarios. The Tanimoto index, Dice index, Cosine coefficient and Soergel distance were identified to be the best (and in some sense equivalent) metrics for similarity calculations, i.e. these metrics could produce the rankings closest to the composite (average) ranking of the eight metrics. The similarity metrics derived from Euclidean and Manhattan distances are not recommended on their own, although their variability and diversity from other similarity metrics might be advantageous in certain cases (e.g. for data fusion). Conclusions are also drawn regarding the effects of molecule size, selection method and data pretreatment on the ranking behavior of the studied metrics.},
