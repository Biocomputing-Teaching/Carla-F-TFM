The objective of this work is the discovery of cysteine protease inhibitors using deep learning. To achieve this objective, the chemprop algorithm has been used.

The chemprop Architecture is a neural network built for the prediction of molecular properties that includes a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) module for molecular feature extraction and a feed-forward neural network (FNN) for property prediction.
