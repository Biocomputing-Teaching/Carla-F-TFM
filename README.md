# Covalent inhibitors
Covalent inhibidors are a class of small molecule compounds that can covalently bind to specific target protein inhibiting their biological funcions. 
More of the most important adventages of covalent inhibidors, is their high binding affinity to target proteins, is much more stable than non-covalent inhibitors and prolonging the duration of action. (mirar més avantatges)

A covalent labeling is achieved when a leaving group from an electro-deficient aromatic ring is replaced by a nucleophile, such as cysteine thiol
